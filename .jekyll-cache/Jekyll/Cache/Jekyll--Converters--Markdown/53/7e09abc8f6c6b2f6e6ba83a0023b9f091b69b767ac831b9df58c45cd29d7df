I"ì<p>For some of our <a href="https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2015/11/06/eye_tracking_tech.html">previous</a> <a href="https://pearsonlab.github.io/blog/2016/03/10/nasher_eye_tracking.html">work</a> on eye tracking, we needed to be able to generate videos in way that could be linked into an automated analysis pipeline. For this, we use OpenCV, a tool for advanced frame-by-frame image analysis. Unfortunately, OpenCVâ€™s ability to write movies in common output formats relies on OpenCV being linked to FFMPEG (a video codec library) and compiled manually, so you canâ€™t just install the necessary software with a package manager. The build process can be tricky, with various unique issues arising on different systems. However, with the help of modern containerization services like Docker, we can bundle a working version of OpenCV into a container and deploy it across platforms. After that, all it takes is two lines at a command prompt to get a working version up and running on any system.</p>
