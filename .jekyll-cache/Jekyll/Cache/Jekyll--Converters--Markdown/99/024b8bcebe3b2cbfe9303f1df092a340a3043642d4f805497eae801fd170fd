I"s<p>As the new school year begins, the Pearson lab has to say farewell to two of its amazing members, Sam and Jack. Both of them are heading off to begin graduate school. We are so proud of them and wish them the best in their future research pursuits!</p>

<p>Sam will be attending the Emory Biostatistics PhD program to work on modeling high-dimensional time-series data and Bayesian methods. He says he chose this program because the faculty has a broad range of research interests and the curriculum is both rigorous and eclectic (two years of coursework and separate training for teaching).</p>

<p>Jack will be attending the Duke Computer Science PhD program, not so far away! He says that he is looking forward to developing machine learning techniques for behavioral analysis, particularly animal movement behavior and human linguistic and musical behavior.
