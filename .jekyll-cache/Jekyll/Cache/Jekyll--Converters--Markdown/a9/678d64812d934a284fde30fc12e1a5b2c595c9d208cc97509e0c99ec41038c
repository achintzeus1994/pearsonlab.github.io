I"¹<p>The Atlantic recently did a cool <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-return-of-electroshock-therapy/413179/">feature</a> on Dr. Sarah (Holly) Lisanby that highlights some of the work she has done over the course of her career regarding ECT (Electro-Convulsive Therapy).  The article is really well done, and I would recommend checking it out.  As with anything on the internet though, avoid the comments.</p>
