<p>Today, we’re launching the website for P[λ]ab, the Pearson Lab at Duke University. The plan is to use this blog for lab news, ongoing projects, and things we just think are cool.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about us:</strong> As a lab, we focus on designing next-generation analysis methods for neuroscience data. Much of our work attempts to deal with large datasets, while other efforts focus on projects with clinical application. You can read more about <a href="/about.html">our vision</a>, <a href="/people.html">our team</a>, and <a href="/research.html">our research</a> on the site.</p>

<p><strong>A few words about our name:</strong> Our work brings together neuroscience, computation, and statistics, and so our logo merges several elements symbolizing these ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>three connected nerve cells, the simplest possible “neural network”</li>
  <li>λ, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">symbol for computation</a></li>
  <li>P[·], the notation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability">probability of an event</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for visiting. We’ll be hoping to update this space regularly, so check back for project updates, new results, and more.</p>
