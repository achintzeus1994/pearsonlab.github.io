I"{<p>If you saw or heard about my talk at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego and are looking for the slides (including videos), they can be found at <a href="https://pearsonlab.github.io/sfn-talk-2016">pearsonlab.github.io/sfn-talk-2016</a>.</p>

<p>We are currently working on a manuscript and refining the models, but all the modeling and analysis code, as well as code for the task itself, will eventually be made public on our <a href="https://github.com/pearsonlab">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, congratulations to <a href="http://shariqiqbal2810.github.io/">Shariq</a> and Caroline, who put in all the hard work!</p>
