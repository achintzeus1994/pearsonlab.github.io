I"±<p>Weâ€™re located in the <a href="http://maps.duke.edu/map/?id=21#!s/key=lsrc?m/6561">Levine Science Research Center</a>. LSRC is big, making it easy to find, but perhaps not easy to find us specifically. Our labâ€™s office number is C03C, which is in the basement level of the C-Wing.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re coming from West Campus (Bryan Center, Chapel, etc.), first find the section of LSRC by the DIBS cube, that shiny glass box just off the large lawn.</p>

<p>Alternately, if youâ€™re coming from Erwin Road, Circuit, or Research Drive, this is the view of the entrance from the traffic circle:</p>

<p>and you should walk straight through until you see the DIBS glass cube in the first photo. Then, walk further down to this entrance (C-Wing):</p>

<p>Once inside, immediately go to the door on the right and take the stairs down to the basement.</p>

<p>Turn right once more and youâ€™ll see the entrance to the Center for Cogntitive Neuroscience (CCN). This door is kept locked, so please knock to be let in.</p>

<p>Our office (C03C) is the first door on the right!
