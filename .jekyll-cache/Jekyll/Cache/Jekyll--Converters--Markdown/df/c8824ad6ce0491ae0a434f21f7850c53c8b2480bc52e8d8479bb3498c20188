I"ê<p>This week, new work from the P[Î»]ab investigating neural mechanisms underlying social decisions went live (open access) on <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/09/1514761112.abstract">PNAS</a>. This work, led by the <a href="http://changlab.net/">Chang</a> and <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/michael-platt-appointed-penn-integrates-knowledge-professor">Platt</a> labs, builds on a series of elegant experiments Steve Chang began when he and John were postdocs together in Platt Lab at Duke. In this most recent paper, we report that single neurons in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala">amygdala</a> respond differently depending on who benefits from rewarding outcomes, and that administering the chemical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">oxytocin</a>, which plays a role in birth and bonding, altered the decisions animals made when choosing between rewards to themselves alone or themselves and a partner (they got more generous).</p>
