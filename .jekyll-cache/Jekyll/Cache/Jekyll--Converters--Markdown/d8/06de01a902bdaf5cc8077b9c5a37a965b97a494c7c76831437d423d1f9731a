I"§<p>In the P[Î»]ab, one of our main research focuses is eye-tracking. We have a collaboration with <a href="/people.html">faculty</a> in the Psychiatry department looking at <a href="https://github.com/pearsonlab/pupil">pupillometry</a> and its relationship to fear. Currently weâ€™re using screen based eye-tracking devices that provide gaze coordinates in terms of where on the screen you are looking. Recently, we obtained some brand new <a href="http://www.tobii.com/">Tobii</a> Eye-Tracking Glasses that can allow us to expand beyond screen-based experiments, and in the last couple weeks we seen some exciting developments that will allow us to do really cool research!</p>
